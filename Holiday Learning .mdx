# Linear Algebra Learning To-Do List for Spring

## Vectors and Matrices
- [ ] Understand vectors as points and directions in space
- [ ] Grasp the concept of matrices and their role in transformations

## Basic Operations
- [ ] Practice vector addition and subtraction
- [ ] Master dot product for vectors
- [ ] Learn matrix multiplication and its rules
- [ ] Understand matrix transposition
- [ ] Study the concept of matrix inversion

## Advanced Concepts
- [ ] Explore linear independence and span
- [ ] Learn about eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  - [ ] Relate to PCA and dimensionality reduction

## Norms and Spaces
- [ ] Study different vector norms (L1, L2)
- [ ] Understand matrix norms
- [ ] Comprehend orthogonality and orthogonal projections

## Further Topics
- [ ] Learn about determinants
- [ ] Study Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - [ ] Apply to dimensionality reduction techniques

## Special Matrices
- [ ] Investigate properties of symmetric matrices

## Additional Learning
- [ ] Read "Linear Algebra and Its Applications" by Gilbert Strang
- [ ] Enroll in an online course:
  - [ ] [Coursera's Linear Algebra for ML](link if available)
  - [ ] [EdX's Linear Algebra course](link if available)
- [ ] Participate in coding challenges or projects that involve linear algebra in ML

## Goals by Spring
- [ ] Complete reading of key chapters from selected textbook
- [ ] Finish at least one online course on linear algebra
- [ ] Implement at least three machine learning algorithms using linear algebra concepts
- [ ] Solve practical problems or contribute to projects on platforms like Kaggle or GitHub

Remember to practice regularly, as application solidifies understanding.
