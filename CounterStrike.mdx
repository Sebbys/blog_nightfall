## What is Counter Strike?
Counter Strike is a multiplayer FPS game developed by Valve Corporation. It was first released in 1999 as a mod for the popular game Half-Life and gained a cult following. Later, in 2000, Valve released a standalone version of the game, Counter Strike 1.6, which became a massive hit. Since then, the game has gone through various updates and iterations, with the latest being Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO).
## The Gameplay
In Counter Strike, players are divided into two teams â€“ terrorists and counter-terrorists. Each team has a specific goal to complete, which involves either planting or defusing a bomb, rescuing or guarding hostages, or eliminating the opposing team. The game is played in rounds, and the first team to win 16 rounds wins the match.
